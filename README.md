# BinaryTreePostOrder

Using the binary tree provided, multiple methods were created to find the height of the tree, the post-order traversal, and the number of nodes.

### PROVIDED:
  - TreeInterface, BinaryTreeInterface, and EmptyTreeException

### MY CHANGES:
  - create the method, ```postorderTraverse_binaryNodeMethod()```. This prints all nodes from the tree using post-order traversal
